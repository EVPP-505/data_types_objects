Today we are going to discuss the foundations of data in R, namely, the basic types of data and objects R supports and manipulates.

## Data types

The basic types of data in R:

1. Numeric:
    i) Integer;
    ii) float or double;
3. Logical;
4. Character (strings);
5. Complex;

These together form the basis of *Atomic* vectors (See the chapter on [vectors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) in R for Data Science).

## Data objects

There are simple objects:

1. Vectors;
2. Arrays/Matrices

and more complex objects:

3. Data Frames/Tibbles
    i) See the [tibbles](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) chapter for more information
4) Lists



## Operations

### Basic math operators:
$+, -, *, /$

### MATRIX operators:
%*%  
%+%



## Indexing vectors
